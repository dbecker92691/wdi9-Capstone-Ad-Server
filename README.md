# wdi9-Capstone-Ad-Server
MVP 

The project will consist of two sides
    - a client side and a customer side
    
    The client side will allow a client to:
        - create an account
        - log in/log out
        - create a program
            - contains budget
            - run time
            - program targeting
            - upload program assett (.png)
        - Edit thier program
        
        
    The customer side will:
        - provide a 3 question form
            - age
            - sex
            - location (zip code)
        - upon completing the form the customer will be served an ad
          based on the program that best fits thier description
            - ex. If a customer fills out that they are a woman between 25 - 35 
              and a program has that as their primary targeted user their add will be shown
